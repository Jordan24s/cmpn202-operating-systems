# Week 1 – System Planning and Distribution Selection

## Overview
This week focused on planning the system architecture and selecting an appropriate Linux distribution for the server environment.

## System Architecture
The system consists of a headless Linux server administered remotely via SSH from a separate workstation.

## Distribution Selection
Ubuntu Server was selected due to its long-term support, strong community documentation, and built-in security features.

## Network Configuration
The server and workstation communicate over a VirtualBox host-only network.

## System Specifications (CLI Evidence)
The following commands were used to gather system information:
- uname -a
- free -h
- df -h
- ip addr
- lsb_release -a

## Reflection
This planning stage established the foundation for secure remote system administration.
