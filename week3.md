# Week 3 – Application Selection for Performance Testing

## Selected Applications
Two applications were selected to represent different workloads:
- stress (CPU-intensive)
- iperf3 (Network-intensive)

## Installation
Applications were installed via SSH using the system package manager.

## Expected Resource Usage
The selected tools are expected to increase CPU and network usage during testing.

## Reflection
Simple tools were chosen to clearly observe operating system behaviour.
